======

A barebones MVC PHP framework.

This framework can be a foundation to any web project (website, REST API, content management system, intranet, ecommerce, etc.). It is built on the principles of flexibility, rather than attempting to do everything.

The framework aims to be extemely low in overheads (in terms of number of files, and number of function/method calls to on each load).

The framework is loosely based on the MVC model.
